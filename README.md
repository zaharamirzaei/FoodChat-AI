# FoodChat-AI üç¥ü§ñ

FoodChat-AI is an intelligent chatbot prototype designed as part of a course project. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) along with LangChain and LangGraph to handle user queries in different domains of a food-assistant application.  

The project demonstrates modular chatbot design where the main LLM agent dynamically routes user queries to specialized modules (e.g., food info, customer services, food search, and food suggestions).  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This chatbot is not a real food-ordering system. It is a virtual assistant prototype focused on answering queries, providing suggestions, and simulating customer support tasks.
